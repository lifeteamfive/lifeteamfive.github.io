	<h2>About Us</h2>
	<p id="description">For years, our oceans have been disregarded and sorely mistreated.  
	Our company aims to bring life back to the oceans by implimenting our solar powered
	machines that will collect the plastic that has been polluting our oceans for so long.
	Wih your help, we can reinvigorate our oceans and make the future a better place. </p>

	<h2>Our Purpose</h2>
	<p>At L.I.F.E we devote our time to make earth a better place. Earth has such a massive area with billions of people, hundreds of countries, and endless amounts of problems. So what can we do to help? We can start by cleaning our oceans.

	<h2>The Problem</h2>
	<p>Our oceans are being infiltrated with billions of tons of waste every year. We have to act as soon as possible to fix this problem. If we don't the human race is at stake.</p>
	<div class="line"> </div>
	<h2>Our Product </h2>
	<p>Our product is called the "L.I.F.E. bot" and its purpose is to clean our oceans. It is made entirely out of plastic and the technological innovations inside of it include the battery that powers it, a filtration system, and storage to hold waste. With this waste we separate the garbage from the items that can be recycled such as glass, plastic, and metal. If we were to go to an area of water that is polluted with oil, the "L.I.F.E. bot" can distinguish the densities between oil and water thus keeping the oil as waste and returning the water back to the ocean.  </p>

	<h2>What We Do </h2>
	<p>Cleaning the oceans is currently our main goal. Eventually we intend on progressing into cleaning all aspects of this earth. Our next step will be most likely to reduce and eliminate carbon emissions. This earth needs someone to make a difference and we believe that we are fit for the job. </p>
