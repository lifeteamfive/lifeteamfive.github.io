	<p id="description">For years, our oceans have been disregarded and sorely mistreated.  
	Our company aims to bring life back to the oceans by implimenting our solar powered
	machines that will collect the plastic that has been polluting our oceans for so long.
	Wih your help, we can reinvigorate our oceans and make the future a better place. </p>
